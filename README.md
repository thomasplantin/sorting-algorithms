# Sorting algorithms

This simple project serves as a visualization tool for 4 sorting algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quicksort

Thanks to the visualizations, you can tell which sorting algorithms are the most efficient.

# What I learned

- Provide visual representations to complex sorting algorithms.
- Render the visualizations at a rate specified by the user.
- Get a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms.
